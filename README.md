# Portfolio Insight

Build a premium, modern, responsive Stock Market Portfolio Tracker web application.

The product should feel like a high-end fintech SaaS product with a black + yellow visual identity, cinematic motion, subtle 3D depth, animated typography, premium dashboards, and strong usability.

The website must look sophisticated and expensive, not like a generic dashboard template.

1. Product Overview

Create a portfolio tracking platform for retail stock market investors.

The product should help users:

Add and manage stock holdings

Track total portfolio value

Understand total invested amount

See profit/loss in rupees and percentage

Analyze portfolio allocation

Monitor individual holdings

Review transaction history

View portfolio performance over time

Maintain a stock watchlist

Receive simple price alerts

Import holdings through CSV

Understand their portfolio without complicated professional trading tools

This is a portfolio tracking and analytics product, not a trading platform.

Do not include automatic trade execution.

Do not provide personalized financial advice such as:

"Buy this stock"

"Sell this stock"

"This stock is best for you"

The experience should focus on information, tracking, visualization, and portfolio awareness.

2. Primary Target Users

Optimize the MVP primarily for:

Beginner Retail Investors

People who have started investing but find traditional trading platforms confusing.

Their needs:

Simple terminology

Easy portfolio setup

Clear profit/loss

Easy-to-read charts

Portfolio overview without financial jargon overload

Long-Term Retail Investors

Users who hold stocks for months or years and want to understand:

Current portfolio value

Overall returns

Allocation

Individual holding performance

Portfolio history

Secondary users can include active investors, but do not design the MVP like a professional trading terminal.

3. Geography and Market

Optimize the first version primarily for:

Pakistan Stock Exchange — PSX

Currency:

PKR / Rs

Example stock symbols may include:

ENGRO

MEBL

SYS

FFC

LUCK

UBL

HBL

However, architect the product so support for US and international markets can be added later.

4. MVP Portfolio Setup

Support these portfolio setup methods:

Primary

Manual stock entry

Users enter:

Stock symbol

Company name

Quantity

Buy price

Buy date

Optional notes

Secondary

CSV import

Allow users to upload a CSV containing:

Symbol

Quantity

Buy price

Buy date

Show a preview before importing.

Do not implement brokerage account integration in the MVP.

5. Supported Assets

MVP should support:

Stocks

ETFs

Cash

Architecture should be extendable later for:

Mutual funds

Crypto

Options

Bonds

Do not make these advanced asset classes prominent in the MVP.

6. Core User Job

The primary outcome should be:

"I want to instantly understand how my portfolio is performing."

The dashboard must immediately answer:

How much have I invested?

What is my portfolio worth now?

Am I in profit or loss?

What is my return percentage?

Which stocks are performing best and worst?

How is my money allocated?

How has my portfolio changed over time?

These insights should be visible within seconds of opening the dashboard.

7. Business Model

Design this as a freemium SaaS product.

Free Tier

Include:

One portfolio

Manual holdings

Basic performance tracking

Basic charts

Holdings table

Watchlist

Limited alerts

Premium Tier

Future premium features may include:

Multiple portfolios

Advanced analytics

Sector allocation insights

Risk analytics

Benchmark comparisons

Unlimited alerts

CSV exports

Advanced historical analytics

Create subtle upgrade touchpoints but do not make the free experience feel intentionally broken.

8. Product Constraints

Design around these constraints:

Web-first application

Fully responsive

Desktop, tablet, and mobile support

Delayed or end-of-day market data is acceptable for MVP

No automated trading

No brokerage credentials

No investment advisory recommendations

Secure user authentication

Sensitive financial information must be treated carefully

Market API keys must never be exposed in frontend code

Data fetching should happen through secure backend/API routes

Keep architecture ready for live APIs later

9. Information Architecture

25. Gradient System

Use gradients sparingly.

Hero glow:

radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,212,0,0.16) 0%, rgba(255,212,0,0.03) 42%, transparent 70%)

Card yellow glow:

linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,212,0,0.10), rgba(255,212,0,0.01))

37. Hero Motion System

Upgrade the hero section with premium, realistic, smooth, modern motion.

If an existing hero section already exists:

Keep its:

Content

Branding

Layout structure

Colors

Typography

Overall visual direction

Main headline

Supporting paragraph

CTA buttons

Hero dashboard visual

Decorative elements

Use:

Opacity

Small translateY

Tiny scale adjustment

Blur-to-sharp reveal

Natural stagger

Preferred easing:

cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)

39. Animated Headline

The hero headline must feel premium.

Animate by:

Line

Phrase

Small grouped words

Each line should:

Start:

Slightly lower

Slightly blurred

Lower opacity

Then naturally settle into final position.

Keep the animation smooth.

Example timing:

First line:

0.55s

Second line:

0.7s

Supporting text starts shortly afterward.

40. Animated Text Across Website

Important metrics

Feature titles

CTA groups

Do not animate every paragraph.

Use small translateY distances around:

8–18px

Opacity:

0 → 1

Optional blur:

4–6px → 0

Use viewport-triggered animations only once unless there is a strong reason otherwise.

Do not create excessive movement.

41. Hero Visual Motion

The 3D dashboard visual should continuously float.

Use:

Vertical movement:

approximately 6–10px

Horizontal drift:

approximately 2–4px

Rotation:

less than 1 degree

Duration:

8–12 seconds

Use smooth easing.

The movement should be barely noticeable.

If hero dashboard visual contains several layers:

Main dashboard:

Movement factor 1

Floating metric card:

Movement factor 1.2

Background glow:

Movement factor 0.35

Foreground:

8–12px

Main dashboard:

4–8px

Maximum rotation:

rotateX ±2deg

rotateY ±2deg

Use smooth interpolation.

Add subtle highlight/reflection following the pointer.

Do not apply this behavior to complex tables or form cards.

45. Ambient Background Motion

Duration:

150–250ms

Secondary CTA:

Use smaller surface/background transition.

47. Metric Number Animation

When dashboard metrics first become visible:

Animate numeric values from a sensible starting value to final number.

Example:

Rs 0

→

Rs 1,248,500

Duration:

600–900ms

Only run this once per page load.

Do not constantly animate financial numbers.

Respect reduced-motion settings.

48. Chart Entrance Animation

When charts load:

Line chart should draw from left to right subtly.

Area fill should fade in.

Donut segments may reveal smoothly.

Avoid elastic animation.

Charts should become readable quickly.

49. Scroll Interaction

As user scrolls away from hero:

Hero text:

Moves normally.

Hero dashboard visual:

Moves slightly slower to create depth.

Optional:

Tiny scale reduction from:

1 → 0.985

Do not pin the hero.

Do not hijack scrolling.

Do not create horizontal scroll.

50. Motion Timing

150–300ms

UI entrances:

500–900ms

Hero visual reveal:

700–1200ms

Floating motion:

Motion / Framer Motion

CSS transforms

CSS keyframes

Use requestAnimationFrame only for cursor parallax where needed.

Use:

transform

opacity

Use filters only sparingly.

Avoid animating:

width

height

top

left

Avoid unnecessary React state changes on every mousemove.

52. Performance

Target smooth 60 FPS on modern devices.

Requirements:

No layout shift

No horizontal overflow

No laggy pointer tracking

No large blur filters

No hydration errors

No unnecessary event listeners

55. Accessibility Standards

Target WCAG 2.2 AA.

Requirements:

Contrast

Ensure text/background contrast is compliant.

Do not place yellow text on white/light yellow.

Keyboard

All interactive controls must be keyboard accessible.

Focus

Never remove focus outlines without replacement.

Forms

Every input must have a visible label.

Do not rely only on placeholders.

Icons

Icon-only buttons need accessible names.

Charts

Provide textual summaries.

Example:

"Portfolio increased 12.4% during the last 12 months."

Do not rely only on chart color.

Financial Performance

Positive and negative values must use:

Color

Icon

Text/sign

Example:

↑ +4.8%

and

↓ -2.1%

Never communicate performance using color alone.

Touch

Minimum recommended touch target:

44 × 44px

56. Responsive Layout

Desktop

Sidebar:

240–260px

Content uses remaining width.

Maximum content width:

approximately 1600px

Dashboard uses 12-column grid.

Tablet

Collapse sidebar.

Use 2-column cards where possible.

Mobile

Single-column dashboard.

Cards stack vertically.

Use bottom navigation.

Tables should transform intelligently.

For holdings on mobile, use cards instead of forcing users to horizontally scroll huge tables.

57. Header Design

Logo should combine:

Simple icon + wordmark.

Possible icon concept:

Stylized upward financial line inside a minimal geometric symbol.

Do not use cliché dollar signs.

Brand placeholder:

Portfolia

or

Stockfolio

Use a neutral placeholder name if no brand is provided.

58. Search Experience

Create a global search.

Keyboard shortcut on desktop:

⌘ K

or

Ctrl K

Search stocks by:

Symbol

Company name

Results should show:

Symbol

Company

Exchange

Latest available price

Action:

Add to portfolio

Add to watchlist

59. Data Visualization Style

Charts must match the dark theme.

Chart background:

transparent

Grid lines:

#252525

Primary portfolio line:

#FFD400

Secondary benchmark:

#70706C

Positive:

#32D583

Negative:

#F04438

Tooltips:

Dark elevated card.

Use rounded corners.

Use tabular numerals.

60. Security UX

Include clear messaging such as:

"Your portfolio data is private."

"Broker credentials are never required."

For sensitive settings/actions:

Require confirmation.

Delete account:

Use confirmation dialog.

Never expose API keys in frontend environment variables intended for clients.

61. Suggested Technical Stack

If creating a new project:

Use:

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

Supabase

PostgreSQL

Framer Motion / Motion

Recharts

Use Supabase for:

Authentication

Database

Row Level Security

Suggested tables:

profiles

id

name

email

created_at

portfolios

id

user_id

name

currency

created_at

holdings

fees

transaction_date

watchlist

id

user_id

symbol

created_at

alerts

active

62. Market Data Architecture

Do not hard-code fake live prices into production logic.

Create an abstraction such as:

marketDataService

Functions:

searchStocks(query)

getQuote(symbol)

getHistoricalPrices(symbol, range)

getMarketStatus()

For development, mock data can be used.

The architecture should allow replacement with a provider such as:

Twelve Data

Finnhub

Alpha Vantage

Official PSX-compatible data provider

All API requests must be handled securely through backend/server functions.

63. Sample Dashboard Data

Use realistic sample data for UI demonstration.

Portfolio Value:

Rs 1,248,500

Total Invested:

Rs 1,100,000

Profit:

+Rs 148,500

Return:

+13.50%

Holdings:

ENGRO

MEBL

SYS

FFC

LUCK

Cash

Do not imply the sample data is investment advice.

64. Premium Visual Details

Add restrained details such as:

Hairline borders

Subtle inner shadows

Yellow edge highlights

Dark glass surfaces

Layered transparency

Gentle depth

Crisp typography

High-quality chart tooltips

Premium number formatting

Animated active navigation indicator

Smooth modal transitions

Subtle page transition

Do not overuse glassmorphism.

Readability always takes priority.

65. Overall Motion Direction

The user should perceive:

"This product feels alive and expensive."

They should NOT think:

"This page has a lot of animations."

Motion must feel:

Physically believable

Controlled

Smooth

Subtle

Intentional

Premium

Avoid:

Bounce animations

Huge translations

Constant scaling

Fast spins

Flashing effects

Random floating objects

Animation on every element

Generic fade-ins everywhere

Scroll-jacking

Excessive blur

66. Final Quality Requirements

Visual

Black is clearly the dominant color

Yellow is used strategically

Typography looks premium

Dashboard has strong hierarchy

3D styling is subtle and sophisticated

Cards do not look like generic admin templates

UX

A beginner understands the dashboard immediately

Main financial metrics are visible above the fold

Add Holding takes very few steps

Portfolio P/L is easy to understand

Empty states guide users toward action

Error messages explain what happened

Motion

Hero entrance feels cinematic

Text reveals are smooth

Dashboard mockup has subtle depth

Cursor parallax is restrained

Mobile animations remain lightweight

Reduced motion works correctly

Technical

Responsive at all breakpoints

No horizontal overflow

No broken mobile tables

No excessive rerenders

No API keys exposed

Accessible form labels

Keyboard navigation works

Loading/error/success states are implemented

No large layout shifts

Animations remain GPU-friendly

Final Implementation Direction

Do not create a generic stock trading dashboard.

Create a premium portfolio intelligence experience for everyday investors.

The strongest visual combination should be:
